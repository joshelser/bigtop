Description: Apache Accumulo is a highly scalable structured store based on Googleâ€™s BigTable.
 Accumulo is written in Java and operates over the Hadoop Distributed File
 System (HDFS), which is part of the popular Apache Hadoop project. Accumulo
 supports efficient storage and retrieval of structured data, including queries
 for ranges, and provides support for using Accumulo tables as input and output
 for MapReduce jobs. Accumulo features automatic load-balancing and
 partitioning, data compression and fine-grained security labels.

Package: accumulo-master
Architecture: all
Depends: accumulo (= ${source:Version})
Description: The Accumulo Master server.
 The Accumulo Master is responsible for detecting and responding to TabletServer
 failure. It tries to balance the load across TabletServer by assigning tablets
 carefully and instructing TabletServers to unload tablets when necessary. The
 Master ensures all tablets are assigned to one TabletServer each, and handles
 table creation, alteration, and deletion requests from clients. The Master also
 coordinates startup, graceful shutdown and recovery of changes in write-ahead
 logs when Tablet servers fail. Multiple masters may be run. The masters will
 choose among themselves a single master, and the others will become backups if
 the master should fail.

Package: accumulo-tserver
Architecture: all
Depends: accumulo (= ${source:Version})
Description: The Accumulo TabletServer daemon
 The TabletServer manages some subset of all the tablets (partitions of tables).
 This includes receiving writes from clients, persisting writes to a write-ahead
 log, sorting new key-value pairs in memory, periodically flushing sorted key-
 value pairs to new files in HDFS, and responding to reads from clients, forming
 a merge-sorted view of all keys and values from all the files it has created
 and the sorted in-memory store. TabletServers also perform recovery of a tablet
 that was previously on a server that failed, reapplying any writes found in the
 write-ahead log to the tablet.

Package: accumulo-gc
Architecture: all
Depends: accumulo (= ${source:Version})
Description: The Accumulo Garbage Collector daemon
 Accumulo processes will share files stored in HDFS. Periodically, the Garbage
 Collector will identify files that are no longer needed by any process, and
 delete them.

Package: accumulo-monitor
Architecture: all
Depends: accumulo (= ${source:Version})
Description: The Accumulo Monitor daemon
 The Monitor serves as a log aggregation point for the other servers and
 provides a web UI for basic monitoring.

Package: accumulo-tracer
Architecture: all
Depends: accumulo (= ${source:Version})
Description: The Accumulo Tracer daemon
 The Tracer does distributed profiling of runtime performance. profiling of
 low-level internal operations always happens, and users may optionally turn
 on more comprehensive profiling on a per-table basis.

Package: accumulo-dbg
Architecture: any
Section: debug
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, accumulo (= ${binary:Version}),
